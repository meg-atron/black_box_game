Black Box (game)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

"Black Box gameboard and pieces
Black Box is an abstract board game for one or two players, which simulates shooting rays into a black box to deduce the locations of "atoms" hidden inside.

Black Box is played on a two-dimensional grid. The object of the game is to discover the location of objects ("atoms", represented by metal balls)  hidden within the grid, by the use of the minimum number of probes ("rays"). The atoms are hidden by a person in a two-player game. In a solitaire game, they are either hidden by a computer or they are pre-hidden.  The seeker designates where the ray enters the black box and the hider (or computer or book) announces the result (a "hit", "reflection", or "detour"/"miss"). This result is marked by the seeker, who uses these to deduce the position of the atoms in the black box."

In this version, the guessing player will start with 25 points.  As stated on the Wikipedia page, "Each entry and exit location counts as a point" that is deducted from the current score. If any entry/exit location of the current ray is shared with any entry/exit of a previous ray, then it should not be deducted from the score again. Each incorrect guess of an atom position will cost 5 points, but repeat guesses should not be deducted from the score again.
